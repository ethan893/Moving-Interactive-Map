# Temperature Comparisons & Direct Flight Interactive Map 
This interactive map was to be used for comparing two locations in the preparations of trying to see the difference in their temperature,
and how to get there quickly and cheaply. It allows users to seamlessly click two locations of the map, and find quick temperature data, and
direct flight data between the two locations within a month. Users are only allowed to click on two locations at a time, and if the location does
not have an airport, we will search for the closest airport, and if there is not an airport that is close, we will return the fact that there is
no direct flight or close airport to this location, within the month time frame. 

# HOW TO USE:
To use this application: 
Just left-click on the first location that you want to start at, and then left-click again on the second location being the location you want to get to, and you will be given both of the area's temperatures, their differences in temperatures, and the average and median nearest airport flight costs, if possible.



If there is a direct flight to this location: <img

Then we can see here that the both temperatures will be shown, and the differences of the temperatures will be shown (through the formula of
the first location's temperature subtracted by the second location's temperature)



Otherwise if there is no direct flight to this location:

Then we see here that the program will tell you that there is no direct flight to this location within the month time frame, and that we will only get
the two temperatures of the locations and their differences in temperatures.



To reset the markers, and to be able to click two new markers:
Press **R**, to reset the markers and to remove the lines and you will be prompted with,

where you could click "YES" or "CANCEL", asking for confirmation on whether you really intended to delete both of the markers.
